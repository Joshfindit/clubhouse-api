<!--
Before start writing issue, I won't help you if you're one of following cases:

1. Why this code isn't working? (should go to stackover flow)
2. How to do (some specific and detailed stuff) and give me code if available (DON'T DO THIS)

Followings are good examples of this template:

1. Will this library support (something)?
2. Can (some api function) have numeric argument at this time?

**Environments (please complete the followings):**
- Version: 1.0.17
